	A set of tests for myGengo. They all require internet connections.
	In fact, this entire library and API requires an internet connection.
	Don't complain.

	Also keep in mind that all the test cases test against the Sandbox API,
	since... well, it makes more sense to do that. If you, for some odd reason,
	want/need to test against the regular API, modify the SANDBOX flag at the top
	of this file.
